# idris2-rhone-js : Interactive Single Page Web Applications in Idris2

This is an experimental library about putting a nice API on top
of [idris2-dom](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-dom).
For declaring the interaction between different parts of
a web page, [idris2-rhone](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-rhone),
a small arrowized FRP (functional reactive programming) library
in the spirit of [dunai](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai)
is used.

This is still very much work in progress and *a lot* of stuff
is still missing, but a small and very simple example web page
is already available. Tutorials and documentation are in the making.
